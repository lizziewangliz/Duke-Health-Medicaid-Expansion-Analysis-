## Project Overview

This project evaluates the impact of Medicaid expansion on non-communicable disease (NCD) outcomes across U.S. states. Taking advantage of the staggered adoption of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), we use **causal inference techniques** to assess how access to care affected:

- **Deaths**
- **DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)**
- **Prevalence**
- **Incidence**

We focus on 10 high-burden NCDs using data from the **IHME Global Burden of Disease (GBD)** dataset (2010–2019).

---

## Research Questions

1. How did Medicaid expansion affect disease burden across different states?
2. Are outcomes significantly different in **Early**, **Mid**, or **Late** expansion states versus those that never expanded?
3. Which demographic groups saw the greatest health outcome shifts?

## Methodology

We used a two-step approach to uncover causal impacts:

### 1. **T-Test Filtering for Disease Selection**
- Compared pre- vs post-expansion periods (2010–2013 vs 2014–2019).
- Selected diseases with statistically significant changes (p < 0.05).

### 2. **Causal Inference: DiD and Fixed Effects**
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**: Estimates treatment effect using treat_group × post interaction.
- **Fixed Effects Models**:
  - **State FE**: Controls for time-invariant differences across states.
  - **Year FE**: Adjusts for national policy/time shocks.

## Results Summary

### **Key Findings**
| Expansion Group | Impact | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| **Early**       | ✅ Strongest improvement | Declines in DALYs, Deaths for CKD and Opioid disorders |
| **Mid**         | ⚠️ Mixed results | Only significant when year FE included |
| **Late**        | ❌ Minimal effect | Shorter post-expansion period limited results |

### 👥 **Demographic Insights**
- **Men** consistently showed higher Deaths and DALYs.
- **Older adults (50–69)** bore the highest burden.
- **Substance Use Disorders** had the steepest pre/post policy impact.
